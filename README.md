# Bike-Sharing


# **Context:**

Bike-sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from membership, rental and return has become automatic. Through these systems, the user can easily rent a bike from a particular position and return to another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which are composed of over 500 thousand bicycles. Today, there exists a great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental, and health issues.


# **Problem Statement:**
'Travel Along' is a new bike-sharing company and wants to expand its customer count and provide better services at a reasonable cost. They have conducted several surveys and collated the data about weather, weekends, holidays, etc. from the past 2 years.

I used this information to predict the count of bikes shared so that the company can take prior decisions for surge hours.

I used different ensemble techniques - Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking to build a model to predict the count of bikes rented.
